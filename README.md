# App Name: PocketBuddy

# App Description
- In this technological age, various mobile apps offer services like ordering food, booking cabs, and more. However, these services often come with higher prices. For instance, buying a $14 dish at a restaurant may cost around $20 on a food delivery app. Our app idea addresses this price difference.

Picture an application where users can post diverse tasks, such as ordering a $14 meal from a specific restaurant. A person traveling from that restaurant to the user's home can then pick up and deliver the order. To incentivize the delivery, the person placing the order agrees to add an extra $2 or $3 as a tip, which the delivery person receives as their payment. What makes this concept unique is that the delivery person only invests a small portion of their time, benefiting from an additional $2-$3 during their trip for personal needs. Users can post various tasks, such as transporting a small box from point A to B or obtaining a certificate from XYZ. 

In essence, our app functions like a To-Do list, where users can post various tasks, and others can complete them for a specified payment, creating a platform that fosters a mutually beneficial exchange of services.
